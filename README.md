# snakegame

discription:

This Snake game implementation uses the console for simple text-based graphics and interaction. The player controls the snake with the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys, aiming to eat the fruit and increase their score while avoiding collisions with the snake's own tail. The game ends if the snake collides with itself (gameover becomes true).
